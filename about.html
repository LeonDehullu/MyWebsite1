            <h5>My story</h5>
            <p>My name is Leon Dehullu. I graduated from secondary school (VTI Waregem) where I studies industrial sciences, where I gained a strong foundation in science and technology. Throughout my studies, I developed a keen interest in problem-solving and a passion for developing innovative solutions to complex challenges. 
            </p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing golf and being outdoors. The strategic thinking and focus required for the game are skills that I've found to be useful in both my personal and professional life. I believe that a well-rounded approach to life is essential to success, and I try to incorporate my hobbies and interests into my work whenever possible.</p>
            <p^>I am currently in my second year of industrial engineering (industrial design) at University of Ghent at campus Kortrijk. My academic focus is on the intersection of engineering and design, and I am passionate about using design principles to create innovative solutions. I believe that the key to success in engineering is to have a deep understanding of the user's needs, and to use that understanding to develop products that are both functional and user-friendly.</p>
